You need an intern that can manage everything outside of the photo shoot; workshop development and design, presentational design, print design, managing and designing for the blog— all the fun stuff.</p>

                <p>Sure— I’m a designer and you’re a photographer. Technically, that doesn’t mesh. But I’ve never been known to be technical. Here’s why I think I’m a good fit:</p>
                <p class="list-item">1. I want to be a better creative thinker. As a designer, I want to sharpen my talent, learn to think outside the box and play with different mediums— like chalk, print, motion, and more— as well as develop creative concepts and visions. </p>
                <p class="list-item">2. I want more experience in workshop development. I’m passionate about teaching others design, and would love to teach and develop design workshops and conferences further in my career.</p>
                <p class="list-item">3. I want to learn more about working independently. I intend to be a self-employed designer for as long as I can. I would love to learn how you navigate the self-employment realm— from developing a personal style, client development, to the simple things like answering emails (though— I’m not sure anyone has that figured out yet). </p>
                <p class="list-item">4. I want to use what God’s given me for good. As a Christian, I believe the (albeit raw) talents I have were given to me by God, and I want to give back by using my talents in any way possible. </p>
